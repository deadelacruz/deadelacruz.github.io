# This file contains all configuration for news fetching including topics, keywords, and settings

# API Configuration
api:
  base_url: "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything"
  timeout_seconds: 15
  max_page_size: 100  # NewsAPI maximum
  max_pages: 10  # Maximum number of pages per topic (10 requests × 3 topics = 30 total, safe 20-request buffer under 50 limit per 12 hours)
  language: "en"
  sort_by: "publishedAt"
  rate_limit_delay_seconds: 1.0  # Delay between API calls to respect rate limits

# Date Range Configuration
date_range:
  lookback_days: 30  # How many days back to search from NewsAPI
  exclude_today: true  # Exclude today due to NewsAPI free tier 24-hour delay
  exclude_today_offset_days: 1  # Days to exclude from today
  retention_days: 60  # How many days to keep articles in UI (articles older than this will be removed)

# Article Processing Configuration
article_processing:
  max_description_length: 250  # Maximum characters for article description
  max_title_preview_length: 60  # Maximum characters for title preview in logs
  max_error_text_length: 500  # Maximum characters for error text in logs
  debug_log_filtered_limit: 3  # Only log first N filtered articles to avoid spam

# Metrics Configuration
metrics:
  export_to_json: true  # Export metrics to JSON file
  json_output_path: "_data/news_metrics.json"  # Path for metrics JSON export

# UI Display Configuration
ui:
  articles_per_page: 20  # Number of articles to show per page (default: 20)
  enable_pagination: true  # Enable pagination (true) or show all articles (false)
  show_all_option: true  # Show "Show All" button to display all articles at once

# News Sources Configuration
# Each topic can optionally override max_pages (e.g., max_pages: 10)
# If not specified, uses the global api.max_pages setting (currently 10)
# Total requests = 3 topics × 10 = 30 requests (safe 20-request buffer under 50 limit per 12 hours)
# Workflow runs every 12 hours to align with NewsAPI quota reset cycle
