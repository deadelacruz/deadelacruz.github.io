- title: Machine learning teaches membranes to sort by chemical affinity
  description: Ultrafiltration membranes used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and
    other industrial processes have long relied on separating molecules by size. Now,
    Cornell researchers have created porous materials that filter molecules by their
    chemical makeup.

- title: High-precision analysis of 2D materials microstructures achieved using electron
    microscopy and machine learning
  description: 'A research team led by NIMS has, for the first time, produced nanoscale
    images of two key features in an ultra-thin material: twist domains (areas where
    one atomic layer is slightly rotated relative to another) and polarities (differences
    in atomic o'

- title: 'Early adherence to biofeedback training predicts long-term improvement in
    stroke patients: A machine learning approach'
  description: Biofeedback-based treadmill training generally involves 10 or more
    sessions to assess its effectiveness during stroke rehabilitation. Improvements
    are seen in some patients during the assessment, while others do not progress.
