- title: Machine Learning Discovers Quasars Acting as Lenses
  description: Astronomers have used machine learning to discover seven new quasar
    lens systems, arrangements where a quasar's host galaxy bends light from a more
    distant galaxy behind it. The find more than doubles the number of known candidates
    and demonstrates h

- title: 'CarbaDetector: a machine learning model for detecting carbapenemase-producing
    Enterobacterales from disk diffusion tests'
  description: Carbapenems are last-resort antibiotics, but resistance is rising due
    to hydrolyzing enzymes called carbapenemases. The authors present a machine learning
    algorithm and web-app to rapidly predict carbapenemase-production in Enterobacterales.

- title: Machine learning teaches membranes to sort by chemical affinity
  description: Ultrafiltration membranes used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and
    other industrial processes have long relied on separating molecules by size. Now,
    Cornell researchers have created porous materials that filter molecules by their
    chemical makeup.

- title: High-precision analysis of 2D materials microstructures achieved using electron
    microscopy and machine learning
  description: 'A research team led by NIMS has, for the first time, produced nanoscale
    images of two key features in an ultra-thin material: twist domains (areas where
    one atomic layer is slightly rotated relative to another) and polarities (differences
    in atomic o'
