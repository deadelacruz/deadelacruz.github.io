- title: MRI-based 2.5D deep learning and radiomics effectively predicted microvascular
    invasion and Ki-67 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma
  description: Objective To develop and validate an integrated 2.5D deep learning
    (DL) and Radiomics model using gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI hepatobiliary phase
    (HBP) images combined with clinical features for preoperative prediction of microvascular

- title: Deep learning of thermodynamic laws from microscopic dynamics
  description: We numerically show that a deep neural network (DNN) can learn macroscopic
    thermodynamic laws purely from microscopic data. Using molecular dynamics simulations,
    we generate the data of snapshot images of gas particles undergoing adiabatic
    processes.
